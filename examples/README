This directory contains some example scripts and such that should help 
you get on your way with WWW::Authen::Simple a bit easier.


mysql_schema.sql - SQL create table statements to setup database tables
comptable with the default configuration of WWW::Authen::Simple. They're
very basic (add any other fields you need). They can also be re-arranged
in many different ways, you'll just need to pass WWW::Authen::Simple a
hash that tells it how your tables are structured (see documentation for
more information).

addusers.pl - Simple script to add some test users, and stick them in some
groups. It expects the tables to be structured as laid out in
mysql_schema.sql, and uses the default password encryption, so tweak it
as needed.

example.pl - example of using WWW::Authen::Simple in a cgi script (will
also work under mod_perl and similar environments).
